Lists exercise

Task:

- Create a basic shopping list interface

Requirements:

- Must take a user input
- Must store items in a list
- Must display a small menu system which allows
  the user to do the following actions:
    - Display all items currently in the list
    - Add a new item to the list
    - Remove an item in the list
    - Exit

Things to consider:

- How will you take a user input?
- How will you display a menu?
- How will you control flow depending on the user's
  input after the menu?

Extensions:

(1) Add a way to insert an item at any position in the list
(2) Implement a way to check whether an item actually exists
    before trying to remove it from the list to prevent
    a ValueError from occuring. Hint: use the 'in' operator
(3) Change the display feature so that it displays each item
    on a newline. Hint: iterate over list with a 'for' loop
(4) Display each item in the form 'index: item' on a new line
    for each item. (Requires above extension)
