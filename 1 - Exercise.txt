While loops exercise

Task:

- Create a random number guesser

Requirements:

- Must take a user input
- Must print whether their guess is correct or not

Things to consider:

- How will you generate random numbers?
    - Hint: the Python 'random' module
- How will you take a user input?
- How will you check whether the input matches the random number?

Extensions:

(1) Add a feature that prints whether the user should guess
    higher or lower
(2) Add an option to display 'Play Again?' and accept a yes/no
    or y/n answer
(3) Add a feature that counts the number of guesses the user
    has had and print this out when the user guesses the correct
    number
(4) Add a set number of attempts to automatically end the game
    at (requires above extension)
(5) Add an option before the game starts to choose the number
    range to play in: e.g. 1-100, 1-100, etc...
(6) Add input validation to make sure that a bad input won't
    crash the program. Hint: use try/except blocks
