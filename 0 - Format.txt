Each section will contain the following:

    - Overview:
      - General notes
      - Explanation of usage:
        - Syntax
        - Methods
      - Basic demonstration

    - Small exercise:
      - Task
      - Requirements
      - Things to consider when programming
      - Extensions

    - Exercise notes:
      - General notes
      - Possible approach
      - Solutions:
        - Solution to original task
        - Solution to each extension
        - Solution with all extensions considered

Overview files should be python (.py) files which when
run output information and code used in the demonstration.

Exercise file should be a text file (.txt) with
information about the task.

Exercise notes should be python files (.py), however they
are not intended to be run. They are this file type
as the contain mainly code (some of which will raise errors
as they are partial sections of the main program) and
the notes are for guidance and headers to distinguish what
each block of code represents.
