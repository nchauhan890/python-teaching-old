For loops exercise

Task:

- Create a simple FizzBuzz program


Requirements:

- Must take in a user input to choose how many numbers to display
- Print the numbers 1 to the limit chosen:
  - Replace every multiple of 3 with 'Fizz'
  - Replace every multiple of 5 with 'Buzz'
  - Replace every multiple of 3 and 5 with 'FizzBuzz'


Things to consider:

- How will you take an input from the user?
- How will you check if the number being printed is a certain multiple
- How will you replace the text being printed

Extensions:

(1) Add input validation to check the user input. Hint: the program
    should take an integer more than 1.
(2) Add another multiple to check and replace - e.g. multiples of
    7 should be replaced with 'Fuzz'
