"""Notes on for loops exercise."""

# Notes:

# FizzBuzz is a classic programming question used in interviews; it
# tests whether a programmer can create a functional program.

# There are multiple approaches to this exercise, along with a
# list of requirements that can be altered slightly to focus on
# different aspects of the code:
# You could focus on speed and create a short (but not
#  necessarily readable) piece of code; or
# You could create a piece of code designed for extensibility
# by avoiding hard-coded variables; or
# You could focus on simplicity where variables are hard-coded
# yet the code is highly readable

# (I shall demonstrate each type of approach at the end)



# Approach:

# add walkthrough description
# add code here



# Solutions:

# My solution to the original task:

# add code here


# My solution to extension 1:

# add code here


# My solution taking all the extensions into mind:

# add code here
